                <h2>Next Episode: Tech Bootcamp - July 2023</h2>
                <p>Enrolled into Fullstack Academy</p>
                <p>After I finished a 6 month Cybersecurity boot camp with Kenzy Academy, I was left at a cross-roads. What do I do next? Start applying for entry level cybersecurity jobs? I wasn’t feeling too confident in myself because my 6 months of study was just enough study to confirm how much I didn’t know about anything. I’m grateful for the course but it was the most introductory of introductions to cybersecurity. I did learn how to protect myself online, how to not to leave my phone wi-fi on while not using it, how to be suspicious of using random free public wi-fi connections,how to not to click any/all links from emails or direct messages or texts; how not to open random emails or email attachments, how now to encrypt, how to back-up data in 3 different locations, how to appreciate the value of virtual machines and multi-factor authentication.<br><br>I did learn a decent introduction to cybersecurity, but still I had so much more to learn. Also, I was thinking to myself that who or which company is going to hire me, a felon for dealing drugs, to trust their sensitive confidential data with? I do love cybersecurity, and I faithfully watched every season of "Mr. Robot" as well as listen to every episode of Darknet Diaries by Jack Rhysider…but maybe, I’m thinking, that I’ll have a better chance at Coding and Web Development. Because the security clearances in coding/web development are not as exclusive as they are in cybersecurity.<br><br>Chris Schuhmacher did 17 years in prison convicted for murder. In prison, he joined a school and learned how to code. After his release, in 2017, the San Francisco Tech company “Fandom” hired Chris as a Software Engineer. They gave him the opportunity of a lifetime, and if he can do it, then so can I. If the Silicon Valley has an open mind to hard workers like me who have a passion for Tech as well as a criminal background, then this is my chance to seize the moment, “Carpe Diem”.<br><br>I realized I needed to learn to code, to program, and to develop websites. So my next step was to utilize the education scholarship that my employer Amazon provided me with. They fully pay for my education. So I enrolled into a coding/web development boot camp through Full-Stack Academy, an 8 month course, designed to prepare me to be ready to work. On my own time, I got a 2nd desktop and installed Linux Ubuntu on it to learn the terminal command prompts. Developing skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Linux, VS Code and Github is my next goal to be able to gain the skills necessary to work an entry level Web Dev job. Exciting for this next episode!</p>
