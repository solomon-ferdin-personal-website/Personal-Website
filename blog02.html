                <h2>Next Episode: Tech Bootcamp - July 2023</h2>
                <p>Enrolled into Fullstack Academy</p>
                <p>After I finished a 6 month Cybersecurity boot camp with Kenzy Academy, I was left at a cross-roads. What do I do next? Start applying for entry level cybersecurity jobs? I wasn’t feeling too confident in myself because my 6 months study was just enough study to confirm how much I didn’t know about anything. I’m grateful for the course but it was the most introductory of introductions to cybersecurity. I did learn how to protect myself online, know how to not to leave my phone wi-fi on while not using it, know how to be suspicious of using random free public wi-fi connections, know how to not to click any/all links from emails or direct messages or texts; know how not to open random emails or email attachments, know how now to encrypt, know how to back-up data in 3 different locations, know the value of virtual machines and multi-factor authentication.<br><br>I did learn a decent introduction to cybersecurity, but still I have so much more to learn. Also, I was thinking to myself that who, which company is going to hire me, a felon for dealing drugs, to trust their sensitive confidential data with? I do love cybersecurity, and faithfully listen to every episode of Darknet Diaries by Jack Rhysider…but maybe, I’m thinking, that I’ll have a better chance at learning Coding and Web Development. Because the security clearances in coding/web development are not as exclusive as they are in cybersecurity.<br><br>In 2017, a San Francisco Tech company “Fandom” hired Chris Schuhmacher who did 17 years in prison convicted for murder. They gave him the opportunity of a lifetime, and if he can do it, then so can I. If the Silicon Valley has an open mind to hard workers like me who have a passion for Tech as well as a criminal background, then this is my chance to seize the moment, “Carpe Diem”.<br><br>I realized I needed to learn to code, to program, and to develop websites. So my next step was to utilize the education scholarship that my employer Amazon provided me with. They fully pay for my education. So I enrolled into a coding/web development boot camp through Full-Stack Academy, an 8 month course, designed to prepare me to be ready to work. On my own time, I started learning Powershell in Window 10. Then I got a 2nd desktop and installed Linux Ubuntu on it to learn the terminal command prompts. Developing skills in Powershell and in Linux is my next goal to be able to gain the skills necessary to work an entry level Tech job. Exciting for this next episode!</p>
