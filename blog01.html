                <h2>Discovering Tech - Sept 2022</h2>
                <p>Finding a Career in Tech</p>
                <p>Switching careers and getting into the Tech industry was a challenge and adventure. In my prior career, for the past 8 years, I worked as a Chef. And for 5 years prior to cooking, I worked as a professional cleaner/janitor. Cooking and cleaning is what I did for a living and legit work. I seriously struggled to make it to the next payday in both of these jobs. In college, I had taken a typing class and a Microsoft office class. And this was the extent of my tech experience with computers.<br><br>As a kid, I grew up poor and I was one out of 5 boys. When I was 3 years old my mother divorced and became a single mother to raise my youngest brother and me. We lived on mother’s part-time work, section 8, welfare and food stamps. We moved around a lot, sometimes twice a year until I was in high school. With every move I would lose all my my school friends and have to make completely new friends, which was a challenge for a socially inverted kid. I became rebellious and depressed, started smoking pot, underage drinking, and at 17 years old, I dropped out of high school. I job hopped around a lot, working for various temporary staffing agencies and various restaurants. I managed to get 5 years experience as a house cleaner and 8 years experience as a chef. I became good at cooking and cleaning, but still I hated cleaning other people's messes, and most restaurants would only offer me minimum wage even with almost a decade of cooking experience.<br><br>Years past, and I grew older and by age 39, I realized I desperately needed a career change. Cooking and cleaning financially wasn't cutting it, and as a result, I made some serious legal mistakes. I had got involved with the wrong crowd and landed myself in jail a few times for selling drugs. Nearly all of my co-workers in the cooking and cleaning industry were struggling financially. Few of us could afford cars and we could barely afford rent. We all needed a better wages.<br><br>So I sought out warehouse work and ended up working at Amazon where I made a lot more than the minimum wage offered to restaurant cooks. I was financially and legally in a lot better place, but I knew I needed a technical skill, some sort of vocation or trade (truck driving, HVAC, plumbing, something besides cooking, cleaning, or dealing drugs). I earned my GED diploma but otherwise I didn't know what to do, so I thought I could be a semi-truck driver because I heard they make a lot of money and hire people with criminal records like me. I told my best friend, I was going to be a truck driver and he said, "You should study Tech and be a coder." I thought long and hard about what he said.<br><br>Then I told my girlfriend I was going to be a truck driver, and she said "No, I'll never see you and you'll be gone all the time." So I thought even longer and harder about studying Tech.<br><br>Then within just 4 months of working at Amazon, I joined their Career Choice program, which offers to fully pay for employee’s education. Here was my chance to study Tech. Here was my chance to leave minimum wages in the past, to put jails behind me, and to earn a decent living wage. So I applied to an online tech school, Kenzie Academy, and got accepted into their Cybersecurity certificate program.<br><br>3 months into the class, I earned my 1st Tech Certification, in Network Defense Essentials (NDE) from EC-Council. I was learning tech at a fast pace. Juggling school and work was challenging because I  spent 20-30+ hours a week with school, but it was worth it. I found myself excited to learn all the new material, from the class work, to the lab assignments, to the countless tech YouTube videos.<br><br>After I completed the 6 month Cybersecurity course, I continued my tech education by joining a course called #100 Devs. It's a 7-12 month long Software Engineer/Web Development Coding course taught by Leon Noel. With my new found skills in cybersecurity and coding, I am confident my future will be completely different from my past. My goal is to eventually start picking up tech side gigs of developing websites for entrepreneurs and businesses. And then to eventually get hired on full-time with a tech company as a Software Engineer/Web Developer.<br><br>I want to show that breaking into the tech industry is very possible, even without a lot of previous tech experience, and even for people who have criminal records. When I eventually make it in the industry, I would like to give back and help other underrepresented people in tech or at-risk youth by also mentoring them towards gaining the skills necessary to become future Software Engineers. The #100Devs course is a great place to start, as it's a completely free boot-camp, learn at-your-own-pace, and the material is very thorough, teaching all the skills necessary to become a full-stack Software Engineer.<br><br>Whether joining a boot camp, a college, or self-taught in learning tech, the most important thing is to get started. Starting is the hardest step honestly, but it's the first step towards change and a better future.</p>
